# Swift-Algorithm-Playgrounds

Algorithms and data structures in Swift

The purpose of this repository is to use swift playgrounds and write algorithms / data-structures from basic to most-complicated ones. Leading to easy understanding of iterations used by algorithms with the help of playgrounds.

All code is compilable with **XCode 8.0** and **Swift 3**

Contributions are welcome

## The Algorithms
- [Stack using Array](stackWithArray.playground/Contents.swift)
- [Stack using Linked List](stackWithLinkedList.playground/Contents.swift)
- [Queue using Array](queueWithArray.playground/Contents.swift)
- [Queue using Linked List](queueWithLinkedList.playground/Contents.swift)
